This repository contains a simple Hack program that demonstrates a stack overflow error in a recursive function.  The `foo` function calculates the factorial of a number using recursion, but without proper handling for the base case or a maximum recursion depth check, it eventually leads to a stack overflow exception.  The solution demonstrates a more robust way to handle the recursive call to prevent the error. This example is useful for understanding and illustrating recursion and potential errors in recursive function implementations.
